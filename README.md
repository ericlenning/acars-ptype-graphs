# raob-ptype-graphs
Examine properties of RAOB soundings relevant to evaluating precipitation-type.

The purpose of this project is to test and qualitatively evaluate various methods of forecasting precipitation type using archived RAOB data and comparing the results to representative surface observations.  It allows for direct comparisons of different methods (MaxTAloft, original and revised Bourgouin layer-enegy approaches, temperature-based vs wetbulb based, etc.).  

It also allows for finding and examining specific situations.  Just a few examples include:
* Surface temperatures in certain ranges
* MaxTAloft or MaxTwAloft in certain ranges
* Sfc-based energy in certain ranges
* Soundings with elevated warm layers below certain heights
* Soundings above certain elevations

This project also has the potential to provide statistical or climatological information about RAOBs.
